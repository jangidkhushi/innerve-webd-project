# Innerve-webd-project
This repository contains the landing page of a website as a project for Innerve (The Techfest of IGDTUW) web dev team interview. 

# Project Details 
In the header section there is a navigation bar containing menulist such as About, Services, Portfolio n Blog these can be linked to other pages which can be accessed by clicking on them and there are two buttons too placed in nav bar.<br/>
Then comes the other section in which image is placed and headings and taglines are placed using css. <br/>
At the end there is a footer section.<br/>
I have created this page by taking the reference from the link (landing page) provided on the group.<br/>
