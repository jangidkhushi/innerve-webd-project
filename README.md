# Innerve-webd-project
This repository contains the landing page of a website as a project for Innerve (The Techfest of IGDTUW) web dev team interview. 

# Project Details 
In the header section there is a navigation bar containing menulist such as About, Services, Portfolio n Blog these can be linked to other pages which can be accessed by clicking on them and there are two buttons too placed in nav bar.
Then comes the other section in which image is placed and headings and taglines are placed using css.
At the end there is a footer section.
I have created this page by taking the reference from the link (landing page) provided on the group.
